I have obtained my PhD at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge UK in January 2016 and I have been a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science from 2016 to 2021. I am Associate Professor at the Shanghai Normal University since August 2021.

I study the structure and evolution of the Milky Way using observations of stars in the Milky Way at infrared and optical wavelengths.

<!-- I modify here! Hellloooo. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
